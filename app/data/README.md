# Static GTFS Files
> Regular GTFS: This file represents the "normal" subway schedule and does not include most temporary service changes, though some long term service changes may be included. It is typically updated a few times a year.

The `/app/data/gtfs_subway` directory contains the Regular GTFS Static file downloaded and unzipped from [https://www.mta.info/developers](https://www.mta.info/developers).

The regular GTFS file is downloaded and kept as part of this repository. I plan on updating it if there is an update to the files.

Note that `shapes.txt` is not included as it contains information on the subway line "shapes" that make up the MTA Subway map. Since this is a REST API server, UI-related data will be omitted and relegated to client-side applications.

# GTFS CSV-JSON Data Conversion
The static GTFS files are all in CSV format. I prefer to work with JSON and so wrote a script to generate the GTFS data into JSON. The JSON data is then loaded into memory on server initialization.

The JSON file will be generated by running `convert_csv_to_json.py` in the `/app/scripts` directory then saved in the `/app/data/json` directory. This file is the file that will be used.
